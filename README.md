# Alfred_Personal_Assistant
A virtual assistant named after the DC character Alfred Pennyworth (Batman's butler) using Python.

Note: This is made solely for Linux, as modules like pywin32 or os.filestart don't work on Linux. So I had to compromise with alternatives which made the code a bit complex. Also, the voice of the assistant won't be very clear, since I couldn't use sapi5 on Linux and had to settle for espeak, which is not on par with sapi5.

Later on, I will be adding instructions to run the code smoothly.
